chime is a social network in the form of a RESTful API. You can interact with the network using the endpoints outlined below. **Note:** Some `/users/` and `/posts/` GET endpoints below make the use of an auth token optional, for public access to these resources. This means you can access a post with ID: 1 publicly without any authentication required at /posts/1.
